#Insertion Sort - Part 1
[HackerRank \ Algorithms \ Sorting \ Insertion Sort - Part 1](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insertionsort1)
Insert an element into a sorted array.

##Problem Statement
**Sorting**
One common task for computers is to sort data. For example, people might want to see all their files on a computer sorted by size. Since sorting is a simple problem with many different possible solutions, it is often used to introduce the study of algorithms.

**Insertion Sort**
These challenges will cover _Insertion Sort_, a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm. We will first start with an already sorted list.

**Insert element into sorted list**
Given a sorted list with an unsorted number $V$ in the rightmost cell, can you write some simple code to _insert_ $V$ into the array so that it remains sorted?

Print the array every time a value is shifted in the array until the array is fully sorted. The goal of this challenge is to follow the correct order of insertion sort.

_Guideline:_ You can copy the value of $V$ to a variable and consider its cell "empty". Since this leaves an extra cell empty on the right, you can shift everything over until $V$ can be inserted. This will create a duplicate of each value, but when you reach the right spot, you can replace it with $V$.

**Input Format**
There will be two lines of input:

 - $s$ - the size of the array
 - $ar$ - the sorted array of integers

**Output Format**
On each line, output the entire array every time an item is shifted in it.

**Constraints**
$1 \le s  \le 1000$
$-10000 \le V \le 10000, V âˆˆ ar$

**Sample Input**

    5
    2 4 6 8 3

**Sample Output**

    2 4 6 8 8
    2 4 6 6 8
    2 4 4 6 8
    2 3 4 6 8

**Explanation**

$3$ is removed from the end of the array.<br/>
In the $1$<sup>st</sup> line $8 > 3$, so $8$ is shifted one cell to the right. <br/>
In the $2$<sup>nd</sup> line $6 > 3$, so $6$ is shifted one cell to the right. <br/>
In the $3$<sup>rd</sup> line $4 > 3$, so $4$ is shifted one cell to the right. <br/>
In the $4$<sup>th</sup> line $2 < 3$, so $3$ is placed at position $2$.

**Task**

Complete the method <i>insertionSort</i> which takes in one parameter:

- $ar$ - an array with the value $V$ in the right-most cell.


**Next Challenge**

In the [next Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insertionsort2), we will complete the insertion sort itself!
